Hello there, I'm Shivanath.

I currently work as a Software Engineer II at Navi Technologies in Bangalore.

I’ve been planning to write for a long time now, I think it’s time. It's nice to have a small corner in the internet which is fully yours. I hope writing unlike speaking can give me extra time and space to translate my intuitions and abstractions more effectively. I want this blog to a documentation of my relections and learnings.

I'm not sure if I'm passionate about anything really but there are things that I like to do more than the average person. I love to run, have deep conversations. The best conversations involve making fundamental connections among data points you already know. 

I value intelligence, honesty, humility, goodness, openness. Although like everything, it's more complicated than that. If there's a visual representation of "It's complicated", that would be my tattoo. Or maybe "ifs and buts".

Hope you have a good time here!
