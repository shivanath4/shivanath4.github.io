# Improving Cognition: My Journey with Long Term Memory

I am not a person with too many goals in life. I'm usually the kind of person who has interest in a subject for a couple of days or maybe a week depending on how frequently I interact with the subject, and then maybe forget about that or if it gets difficult, quit with frustration. Unless the goal is very important or if the goal has a deep iceberg beneath powering it. One such goal for me would be to try and improve my cognition, which arguably stems from my insecurity.

To improve in anything, you must have a clear understanding of what it is that you're trying to improve on. Unfortunately, in this case, I think it's very complex to define what cognition or intelligence means. Is the world chess champion more intelligent than a person who can remember thousands of digits of pi? Is it the guy who has his IQ in top 0.1 percentile? Or is it the guy who gets a sub 1000 AIR in JEE Advanced? This blog's scope is not about exploring the semantics of the word, instead, we narrow our focus on one of its key pillars -

### Long Term Memory

I consider myself as someone who does not have a particularly great memory, and I want to experiment with whatever is available to try and change that. I wouldn't say I have made it, but I think I have come far enough to share my thoughts with others. So here goes. I'll rank the stuff which has helped me the most or which gives the most value for the buck, and maybe it will help you also.

### Dual-n-back

This is the easiest to recommend. I have been doing dual-n-back quite religiously since the start of this year. I do 12 rounds a day, at least 5 times a week. If I do it on a particular day, I would experience the following benefits:

1. Increased verbal fluency  
2. Increased recollection fluency  
3. Increased confidence (because of 1 and 2)  

I love this because there is a binary answer to "Have you done enough today?" (number of rounds you did) or "Did you do it today?" (completion of 12 rounds). There is a lot of talk about this but maybe that's for another blog.

### Strengthening the connections and thus the nodes

#### Recollect often

It's a no-brainer that the more times you recollect, the better it will be etched in your memory. Repetition without recollection is a lower quality repetition. I don't know about you but I recollect in probabilities. More often than not, I'm not 100 percent sure if what I recollect is accurate. Recollection without validation is a lower quality recollection. Validation can happen internally - you think what you recollected must be true because of a link to another node - or externally where someone says 'yes, that's true'. It's ideal if you can pull it out of your brain after some days - reconstruct the graph, after all the context of it is gone.

While there isn't any straightforward way to measure this on a daily basis, you are naturally forced to recollect if you take on leadership roles — be it in work, be it in a conversation with your friend — it forces you to construct that graph (at least the important bits) every time you want to explain something.

I tend to remember something that I love, and maybe that's because of repetition.

I think there are two types of recollection:

1. **Unlinked recollection:** These are not linked by anything significant. For example, if someone asks you "What did you do throughout the day?" It's just you going back and checking what you did yesterday. It does not have any connection. Morning I could have had a call with my parents, but afternoon I was maybe talking to the girl I like.  
2. **Connected recollection:** Let's say someone asks you to recollect a story. In that case, you should be able to go to any point (forward or backward) from all the connections that you have had before. Point being, logical connections (that help in the story) are stronger than others. You ideally want both, but I think the second type of memory is long-term and more useful than the other.

### Forming more nodes and connections (edges)

#### Sub-vocalization

I got this idea from a friend at work. The idea is to converse with yourself internally - but without sound. What it does is it forces you to have a narrative, a story, it forces you to form the links to the nodes which otherwise does not happen. This is more energy-intensive than letting your thoughts run loose as it requires you to have memory checkpoints (nodes) and the entire story in mind.

If passive consumption creates a 144p node, sub-vocalization is a 420p node and talking out loud with others is a 1080p node. Not every time, you get the opportunity to talk though and it is the most expensive.

It's still very easy for me to forget about this when I am working. And I am not sure how I can make this the default mode of programming or working. Maybe form a habit?

#### Active analysis

Active analysis is not possible without sub-vocalization.

Let's say you start watching a movie. The movie introduces you to a prologue that doesn't make sense at that time. But if you hold that prologue-not-making-sense thought somewhere in your brain and during the middle of the movie, a scene explains the prologue, you connect the prologue with the story. An "aha" moment.

My default way of watching a movie would be to just go with the flow. If I don't understand it, I don't understand. My brain doesn't actively go behind to recollect what happened to understand, nor does it have these unresolved pieces of the puzzle out there waiting for it to be connected. I know this is possible from my best friend. He describes it as pieces of a "puzzle" waiting to be linked. If you are able to do this, that is strengthening the connections that you have, and that just directly translates to better memory.

It is one thing to form the connections during the processing of new information (watching a movie), but it's another thing to have all the data and then form connections post-processing (if I have to explain the movie to someone). In the real world, you do not get a lot of opportunity to process it afterwards unless you intentionally set time aside for doing that. But in academics, you have the liberty to say "ok, I'll think later". Even if your mind wants to connect, it needs to be able to recollect the other piece. Forming connections is dependent on how well you can recollect.

As with writing/anything, I ended up with more questions than answers. If you want to discuss any of these with me, feel free to ping!

### More things to dig deep about:
- Is sub-vocalization mostly about having control over the direction of your thoughts?  
- What does it mean to understand something? How is understanding linked to memory?  
- If relations are "edges", what are the "nodes"? Is it the ill-constructed images (for the lack of a better term)?  
- What's the role of one's ability to byheart affect creation of long term memory?  
- Does short term memory have any bearing at all to long term memory?
