# Improving Cognition: My Journey with Long Term Memory

I am not a person with too many goals in life. I'm usually the kind of person who has interest in a subject for a couple of days or maybe a week depending on how frequently I interact with the subject, and then maybe forget about that or if it gets difficult, quit with frustration. Unless the goal is very important or if the goal has a deep iceberg beneath powering it. One such goal for me would be to try and improve my cognition, which arguably stems from my insecurity.

To improve in anything, you must have a clear understanding of what it is that you're trying to improve on. Unfortunately, in this case, I think it's very complex to define what cognition or intelligence means. Is the world chess champion more intelligent than a person who can remember thousands of digits of pi? Is it the guy who has his IQ in top 0.1 percentile? Or is it the guy who gets a sub 1000 AIR in JEE Advanced? This blog's scope is not about exploring the semantics of the word, instead, we narrow our focus on one of its key pillars -

_Long Term Memory_

I consider myself as someone who does not have a particularly great memory, and I want to experiment with whatever is available to try and change that since quality of life is dependent on it. Over the years, I have analysed and learnt from the best. I wouldn't say I have "made it", but I think I have come far enough to share my thoughts with others. So here goes.

### __Dual-n-back__

This is the easiest to recommend. If there is one thing that you get out of this blog, it should be this. This game is the only scientifically proven exercise which will improve your working memory. I have been doing dual-n-back quite religiously since the start of this year. I do 12 rounds a day, at least 5 times a week. If I do it on a particular day, I would experience increases in:

1. Verbal fluency  
2. Recollection fluency  
3. Confidence (because of 1 and 2)  

Not going to explain the game here. Maybe another blog. Would recommend you to Google though.

I love, love this because there is a binary answer to "Have you done enough today?" (number of rounds you did) or "Did you do it today?" (completion of 12 rounds). Everthing else in here is a lifestyle change which is hard to track / get feedback on.

### Forming better memory nodes and connections

#### Sub-vocalization

I got this idea from a friend at work. The idea is to converse with yourself internally without sound. What it does is it forces you to have a narrative, a running story. If I open my phone to book tickets, but then unintentionally I open Instagram and start scrolling, I'm not sub vocalizing enough. If I open my phone to book tickets and I think to myself, "Okay, I have to book tickets now. Which app do I open?" it makes for a more intentional lifestyle. This is more energy-intensive than letting your thoughts run loose as it requires you to have memory checkpoints and the story in mind.

If passive consumption creates a 144p node (I wouldn't remember why I am on instagram), sub-vocalization is a 420p node (I'm on redBus to book my tickets) and talking out loud with others is a 1080p node (I'm on redBus to book my tickets but in bold fully materialized). Not every time, you get the opportunity to talk though and it is very draining. Subvocalization allows you to have logical relationships between the actions that you're doing.

It's still very easy for me to forget about this when I am working. And I am not sure how I can make this the default mode of programming or working. 

#### Active analysis

Active analysis is not possible without sub-vocalization.

Let's say you start watching a movie. The movie introduces you to a prologue that doesn't make sense at that time. But if you hold that prologue-not-making-sense thought somewhere in your brain and during the middle of the movie, a scene explains the prologue, you connect the prologue with the story. An "aha" moment. You are curious and you want to explain or understand the movie in full.

My default way of watching a movie would be to just go with the flow. If I don't understand it, and If I don't recall who the particular guy was, I don't put so much effort to understand it. My brain doesn't actively go behind to recollect what happened to understand, nor does it have these unresolved pieces of the puzzle out there waiting for it to be connected. I know people do this and that this is possible from my best friend. He describes it as pieces of a "puzzle" waiting to be linked. If you are able to do this, this is strengthening the connections that you have, and that just directly translates to better memory.

If sub-vocalization is creating sequential linear relationships with nodes, active analysis is about making it non-linear and forming an interconnected graph. So it's even better.


### Strengthening the connections and thus the nodes

#### Recollect often

It's a no-brainer that the more times you recollect, the better it will be etched in your memory. Repetition without recollection is a lower quality repetition. I don't know about you but I recollect in probabilities. More often than not, I'm not 100 percent sure if what I recollect is accurate. Recollection without validation is a lower quality recollection. Validation can happen internally - you think what you recollected must be true because of a link to another node (oh that must have been during Dusseshra since when we were traveling in bike, we were seeing huge processions) - or externally where someone says 'yes, that's true'. 

While there isn't any straightforward way to measure this on a daily basis, you are naturally forced to recollect if you take on leadership roles — be it in work, be it in a conversation with your friend — it forces you to construct that graph (at least the important bits) every time you want to explain / talk about something.

I tend to remember something that I love, and maybe that's because of repetition or wonder.

I want to reiterate on the fact that intentional logical links are better than random flow of thought links.

1. **Weakly linked nodes:** These are not linked by anything significant. For example, if someone asks you "What did you do throughout the day?" It's just you going back and checking what you did yesterday. It does not have any connection. Morning I could have had a call with my parents, but afternoon I was maybe having a 1-1 with my manager and evening I went bowling.  
2. **Strongly linked nodes:** Let's say someone asks you to recollect a story. Assuming you have made the graph very connected, you should be able to go to any point (forward or backward) from all the connections that you have had before. Point being, logical connections (that help in the story) are stronger than others. You ideally want both, but I think the second type of memory is long-term and more useful than the other.

While a lot more can be said about memory, I want to conclude it for now. To summarize, if you think you have a weak memory - do dual-n-back, subvocalize as much as possiblbe, analyze as much as possiblbe, assume more leadership roles. Thanks for reading.

As with writing/anything, I ended up with more questions than answers. If you want to discuss any of these with me, feel free to ping!

### More things to dig deep about:
- Is sub-vocalization mostly about having control over the direction of your thoughts?  
- What does it mean to understand something? How is understanding linked to memory?  
- If relations are "edges", what are the "nodes"? Is it the ill-constructed images (for the lack of a better term)?  
- What's the role of one's ability to byheart affect creation of long term memory?  
- Does short term memory have any bearing at all to long term memory?
- Some days, I suck at recollecting simple things. What is the recipe for such a day so I can avoid?
- How does deviating away from the norm impact memory (the wonder factor)?
